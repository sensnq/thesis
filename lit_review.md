# Literature Review Notes

## General

### Enhanced Hydroplaning Prediction Tool

```tex
\cite{lee2020}
```

- Main goal was implementation of the tool, not improving models
- Good point of reference for other articles

### Tire Hydroplaning and Its Effects on Tire Traction

```tex
\cite{horne1968}
```

- Buildup of fluid pressure between tire and ground
- Three types of traction loss:
  - Dynamic hydroplaning
  - Viscous hydroplaning (thin-film lubrication)
  - Reverted rubber skid
- Affect from pavement texture, water depth, tread design, vertical load, and tire pressure

## Hydroplaning Models

## Water Film Thickness Models
