Starting with just the basic concept:
"Development of an advanced hydroplaning prediction tool"
-Building on previous hydroplaning tool
-Use existing models for predicting hydroplaning based on water film thickness (WFT)
-Improve models for estimating WFT based on
	-Rainfall rate
	-Cross-slope and grade
	-Texture/profile depth
	-Rutting
	-Pavement type
-How to improve these models?
	-Use small pavement samples and vary angles to test actual WFT
	-CFD model run on 3D models of samples
	-Develop empirical equations to predict WFT on one "tile"
	-Final model combines effect from multiple tiles
-Tool should input continuous data from MPSV (cross-slope, grade, texture) and design speed from RCI to report continuous hydroplaning risk

-Sample construction
-Need samples of
	-Dense grade
	-Open grade (FC-5, FC-7, ...?)
	-Concrete (long. ground, trans. ground, ...?)
-For all except open, 3D scan and 3D print
-For open:
	-3D scan different aggregate sizes to make aggregate library
	-Generate 3D model programmatically
-WFT measurement
	-Add vertical cylindrical channels in samples
	-Screw-in conductive probe measures height of water at different spots
	-Zero off of reference plane
