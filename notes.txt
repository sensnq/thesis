Starting with just the basic concept:
"Development of an advanced hydroplaning prediction tool"
-Building on previous hydroplaning tool
-Use existing models for predicting hydroplaning based on water film thickness (WFT)
-Improve models for estimating WFT based on
	-Rainfall rate
	-Cross-slope and grade
	-Texture/profile depth
	-Rutting
	-Pavement type
-How to improve these models?
	-Use small pavement samples and vary angles to test actual WFT
	-CFD model run on 3D models of samples
	-Develop empirical equations to predict WFT on one "tile"
	-Final model combines effect from multiple tiles
-Tool should input continuous data from MPSV (cross-slope, grade, texture) and design speed from RCI to report continuous hydroplaning risk
